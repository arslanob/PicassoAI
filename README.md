## Getting Started
Frontend - React

## Task
Create a simple collage site (ex: https://lexica.art/) that uses our text to image api (https://docs.runpod.io/reference/stable-diffusion-v1). 
the application should run locally
all images should be stored locally
user should be able to run multiple parallel calls
the application should store a catalogue of all their outputs and the associated prompt for each

It must be created using react, nodejs backend, but outside of that there are no architecture limitations.


## How to use the app:
-For both fronted and backend:

1.npm install
2.npm start

PS: Enter your runpod API key to backend app.js file.
